# Usage 

## Prerequisite

You must have `node` installed on your machine. Version 12 or above is recommended. 

```
$ node --version
v12.19.0
```

You should have `npm` installed on your machine (version 6 or higher recommended). If you know what you're doing, you can use `yarn` instead.

```
npm --version
6.14.5
```

## Install dependencies

Run the command 

```
npm install
```

## Init or reinitialize the database

Run the command

```
npm run db:init
```

You should run this command the first time you use this repo in order to create the sample dataset (file `data.json`). You may run this command anytime
in order to reset your dataset to the initial sample dataset.

## Start the API server

Run the command 

```
npm run start:api_server
```

This will start an HTTP server on http://localhost:3014. You can now access the API on that URL. See the API documentation for details on endpoints.

## Start the frontend server

```
npm run start:frontend_server 
```

This will start a simple HTTP server on http://localhost:8080, that serves all static files located under the `./frontend` directory.
